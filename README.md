Discord Goflake is a simple and fast Go utility library for handling Discord snowflake IDs.

It contains utilities such as parsing snowflakes and retrieving timestamps from snowflakes.

## Tutorial
**Retrieving timestamp from a raw string ID**
```go
snowflake, err := dgoflake.ParseString("577685297450582016")
if err == nil {
	timestamp := snowflake.Timestamp()
}
```

**Converting epoch milliseconds timestamp to snowflake**
```go
snowflake, err := dgoflake.ParseEpochMilli(1557801521446)
```

See the godocs for the full reference.
